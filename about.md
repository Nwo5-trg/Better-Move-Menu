# Better Move Menu
```
"new-edit-menu": {
    "type": "bool",
    "default": true,
    "name": "New Edit Menu",
    "description": "Changes the object moving menu to have the move button grouped directionally rather than in a list. <cr>Requires re-entering the editor!</c>"
},
```

yeah but like its actually none of that and uses a single move and rotate set of buttons with an input and some shortcuts and stuff :3c
